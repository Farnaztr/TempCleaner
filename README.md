# TempCleaner Batch Script 

This batch script is a simple Windows tool to:
- Delete temporary files from the user and system folders.
- Empty the Recycle Bin.
- Display available disk space using PowerShell.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Copy the code into a file and save it as `tempcleaner.bat`.
2. Right-click the file and choose **"Run as administrator"**.
   > Recycle Bin cleanup and system temp folder removal require admin privileges.

---

## Notes
- If `Clear-RecycleBin` fails, make sure:
  - PowerShell is installed and updated.
  - You run the script with admin rights.
- `wmic` is deprecated. This script uses PowerShell as a modern alternative to show disk usage.
